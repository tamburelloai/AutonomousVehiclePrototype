# Autonomous Vehicle Prototype Project

## Overview
This repository hosts the Autonomous Vehicle Prototype project, developed as part of the **Internet of Things (CS437)** course at the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. This project showcases an integration of object detection, mapping, and motion control functionalities, aimed at advancing autonomous driving technologies.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes TensorFlow Lite to recognize objects in real-time.
- **Advanced Mapping**: Implements occupancy mapping and real-time updates with sensor data.
- **Motion Control**: Supports manual control via keyboard inputs and automated navigation.
